        <li>Elasticsearch was outdated at version 6</li>

        <li>Capacity estimate for the next 5 years</li>
        <li>Deployed the cluster in kubernetes because model training and inference were also running in Kubernetes, and the integration could become smoother</li>
        <li>Higher compute and lower storage to hot nodes and lower compute and higher storage for cold nodes</li>
        <li>Splited each Elasticsearch index into many shards to achieve parallet reads (Each shard did not exceed 600MB)</li>

      <li>P</li>
      <ul>
        <li>In this tool, for each release, there were about 10-20 manual clicks that operation person needs to perform </li>
        <li>On average, each release cycle took 2-4 hours</li>
        <li>Failures were extremely hard to debug because the a lot of pipeline templates written in groovy file contains 3-5k lines of code</li>

        <li>I migrated releases to using Github Action and Terraform</li>

        <li>On average, each release cycle took 10-30 minutes</li>
        <li>The codebase is written in Python and modularized as classes and method, thus it is much easiler to debug</li>

    <h4 class="card-title">Migrating to Job Clusters for Azure Databricks (Layer6 AI)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>S</li>
      <ul>
        <li>All ML use cases were using interactive clusters for inference workload</li>
        <li>Interactive clusters will shut down only after they are not used for more than 10 minutes, during which time the cost will incur</li>
        <li>Accumulated costs from all interactive clusters for all ML use cases were significant, around 5k per month</li>
        <li>I wanted to use job clusters because they would terminate immediately after job finishes</li>
      </ul>
      <li>P</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Inference pipeline was executed in Azure DataFactory and the most straight-forward way was to configure job clusters on ADF UI for each use case</li>
        <li>However, TD internal process demanded that any change to ADF must be maded by TD internal pipeline and go through change approval process</li>
        <li>Going through TD process for each use case whenever I needed to make changes to cluster configuration was unrealistic</li>
      </ul>
      <li>S</li>
      <ul>
        <li>I designed a workaround such that instead of configuring job clusters on ADF UI, I store configuration files for each use case in DBFS</li>
        <li>When inference is run on ADF, it would first read corresponding configuration file in DBFS, and create and run jobs based on that configuration</li>
        <li>When I needed to make changes to cluster configurations, instead of deploying ADF changes for all use case, I could just deploy one notebook in ADB which creates the configuration files in DBFS</li>
        <li>The workaround was accepted by the team and team successfully started using job clusters</li>
      </ul>
      <li>I</li>
