    <ul>
      <li>I graduated in 2015</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Then, I really wanted to become a developer because programming was what I most enjoyed in school</li>
        <li>I spent first 4 months in a start up company as a Javascript developer, but unfortunately the company didn't last long</li>
        <li>Then, I joined Royal Bank of Canada to continue being Javascript developer</li>
      </ul>
      <li>But, after that I joined TD bank to do platform engineering (or what was called then DevOps engineer)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Most problems and challenges I've experienced in Royal Bank of Canada came outside of development</li>
        <li>I worked in 3 different teams</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Team of 20 people, where each individual is assigned to deliver a project in TD Bank</li>
          <li>Project mainly consisted performing the release and also automating the release process</li>
          <li>Team of 7-8 people, where I was primarily focused on pipeline development</li>
          <li>Pipeline was used in a line of business and I provided technical support of pipeline as well</li>
          <li>Team of 20-30 people, where I contributed and enhanced teh enterprise pipeline development</li>
          <li>Here, huge codebase already existed and the customers were the entire enterprised</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>Moved to Layer6 AI to do machine learning engineering</li>
      <ul>
        <li>By the time I graduated, I watched AlphaGo defeating Li se dol. I am from Korean background who also enjoy playing GO, so that came as huge shock</li>
        <li>Thus, I have been studying machine learning on the side so that I can enter this field</li>
        <li>Write data processing and model training logic in Python, using standard library used in the bank which mostly provided abstract classes</li>
        <li>Build model inference pipeline (Azure Data Factory)</li>
        <li>Develope API to perform batch inference as an online endpoint (Kubernetes)</li>
        <li>Perform model monitoring</li>
        <li>Build out machine learning infrastructure using automated pipeline (Databricks, Kubernetes, Azure Machine Learning)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Company</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Company like Layer6 where people strive to keep up with cutting edge machine learning</li>

      <li>Role</li>

        <li>Some procedural or administrative work is unavoidable but there is focus on creative work</li>

        <li>Deployed the cluster in kubernetes because model training and inference were also running in Kubernetes (I wanted native integration between them)</li>
        <li>Higher compute and lower storage to hot nodes and lower compute and higher storage for cold nodes</li>
        <li>Splited each ES index to many shards such that each shard did not exceed 600MB in order to acheive fast read</li>
