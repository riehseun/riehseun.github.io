    </ul>
    <h3 class="card-title">Lessons from experience</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What business told me was rarely what they actually wanted. Requirements were never written in a way that delivered context. I realized I needed interpret the requirements correctly by contiune asking questions.</li>
      <li>Mixing up with agile and waterfall was a mistake because we had fixed set of deliverables by certain date while allow new items to come into the sprint. And we end up infinite amount of work. If items come in, then new items need to come out.</li>
      <li>Manual testing and deployment hit the limit quickly as the application became more complex. We insisted "due deligence" of human effort but we quickly realized that everyone makes mistakes. Automation is not only recommened, it is necessary.</li>
      <li>When we were estimating the work effort, giving a range of time only made business assume the shortest time. I learned to consider the worst case scenario to always make promise that I can deliver, and also apply that principle when doing VSM.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="card-title">Time management</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Pick the three things to do each day at work.</li>
      <li>Check emails only at the beginning and end of the day.</li>
      <li>All meetings shall take place in one day of the week.</li>
      <li>Never spend time on things that are not part of the plan for that day.</li>
