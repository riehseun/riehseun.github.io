        <li>Build and deploy API to do real time inference</li>
        <li>Model monitoring.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>What I liked was</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Technical work, not administrative work</li>
        <li>Creative work, not repetitive work just following playbooks</li>
        <li>Culture where people show ownership</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Most challenging experience, Most complex project, Really hard problem</h3>

    <h5 class="card-title">Elasticsearch cluster migration (Layer6 AI)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Database for storing inference and ground truth data called Elasticsearch, cluster was deployed in 3 virtual machines</li>
      <li>Version 6, open source version, not support authentication, read/write was slow, disk was nearly full</li>
      <li>Migrate Elasticsearch version 6 to 8, apply Enterprise license, capacity estimate for the next 5 years, deployed the cluster in kubernetes, higher compute and lower storage to hot nodes and lower compute and higher storage for cold nodes</li>
      <li>Twice faster in read/write</li>
      <li>Learned to leave lots of time for implementation</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="card-title">Enterprise DevOps pipeline feature enhancement (Wealth SDDE)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>DevOps pipeline for all deployments in the bank</li>
      <li>When mistakes in pipeline configurations, go back to the beginning, no way update deployment configuration in the middle, users could not update configurations in the tool, source of truth had to come from GIT</li>
      <li>New pull request containing release ID of the ongoing deployment, new pull request containing updated configuration</li>
      <li>Users reported deployment time got reduced by twice</li>
      <li>Learned to leave lots of time for testing</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Navigate through a difficult situation, Solve a difficult problem, Tight deadline, Adapted well to change</h3>

    <h5 class="card-title">First ML use case onboarding (Layer6 AI)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>First week in Layer6 AI</li>
      <li>On-board infrastructure for a new use case, given 2 weeks, same amount of time given to experienced members</li>
      <li>Studied the on-boarding document, corrected document while executing, asked lots of questions to team members, pipeline was failing, debugged it to fix the issues</li>
      <li>Took until the very last day to finish. Team said well down, starting showing me trust</li>
      <li>In the beginning, more hours are needed to catch up</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Caculated risk and take, Made tradeoffs in your projects, Made short-term sacrifice for long term gain, Had to make an unpopular decision</h3>

    <h5 class="card-title">Log4J (Layer6 AI)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Log4j issue hit Layer6 AI in December 2021. It allowed remote code execution</li>
      <li>The issue came during weekend, limited responses from the users</li>
      <li>I decided to shut down the containers knowing it will stop daily inference jobs, patched the containers with updated log4j versions, redeployed containers in the production</li>
      <li>Business outage where inference result were not generated, Layer6 was not exploited</li>
      <li>Assessing security risks verses business impact, how to explain technical decisions to business people</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Disaggreement with team member, Conflict on a team, Disagreed with your superior</h3>

    <h5 class="card-title">Helm chart for API based model (Layer6 AI)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>API based ML model, updated code base (helm chart) for resources in Kubernetes, pushed to chart to artifact repository</li>
      <li>Senior member said all applications needed to be re-deployed with updated helm chart immediately to make systems up to date</li>
      <li>There wouldn't be any difference between redeploying immediately or next time there is code change in each app.,explained the time and effort for doing the deployment, he agreed but suggested that we update code repo with updated version, I updated code base</li>
      <li>I saved time for deployment</li>
      <li>Call is easier than chat, need to find a common ground</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Had to go beyond your responsibility, Took the initiative to solve a problem</h3>

    <h5 class="card-title">EDP local development environment (Wealth SDDE)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>The development team had manually set up the local development environment. It took 3 months on average for a new developer to fully setup the complex pipeline environment in his/her local machine. Also, there were some differences between each developer's local environment, which caused bugs in the code. When I join the cloud engineering team, I was told to spend the first 3 months to do the on-boarding.</li>
      <li>Looking at the status quo, I decided to automate the whole on-boarding process rather than going through the manual process.</li>
      <li>I took an initiative to fully automate provisioning and configuration of all pipeline tools. I wrote docker-compose file to deploy containers for tools like BitBucket, Jenkins, XL Release, XL Deploy, and Postgres SQL. I wrote bash scripts to configure all these tools in fully automated way so that everyone in the team would have the exact same local development environment.</li>
      <li>New users started taking only 2 weeks on average to be on-boarded.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Had to prioritize between many projects, Had to manage multiple responsiblitie</h3>

    <h5 class="card-title">Supporting Enterprise DevOps pipeline (Wealth SDDE)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>I was inner-sourcing in cloud engineering, working as a developer for the enterprise pipeline. There were documents that explained how to use the pipeline but the users in the bank were complaining about the supports.</li>
      <li>I had to to perform the role of developer, release engineer, and technical support at the same time.</li>
      <li>I created a FAQ docuemnt that summarized common problems and solutions. When users reported problems that were listed in FAQ, I redirected them to FAQ. I divided my work into three categories and prioritze them so that production issues come first, development work second, and non-production issue the third. I usually advised stakeholders to investigate non-production issues themselves first, and if they cannot solve it after giving several days, I would finally take a look.</li>
      <li>The overall rate of deployment of the pipeline increase about 30% while the average story points of my development work did not suffer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Build something from scratch, You didnâ€™t know how to do or had never done before</h3>

    <h5 class="card-title">Multibranch pipeline (RESL & HOJ)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>We used Jenkins as a tool for continuous integration. Jobs were created manually where scripts were embedded within the jobs. Each job was different, making it very hard to manage the pipeline for each project.</li>
      <li>I wanted systematic approach to setup the pipeline for all projects.</li>
      <li>I wrote multibranch pipeline from scratch using Groovy script so that every project would use the same codebase for continuous integration. And the codebase is stored and updated in one place rather than each job being managed differently.</li>
      <li>Each project in the line of businss reduced time to onboard to continuous integration from 1 week to 1 day on average. Because we established a streamlined way to configure the hooks from code repo to Jenkins and how to configure pipeline for each project in a standardized way.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Made current system better, You worked well within a team</h3>

    <h5 class="card-title">ML infrastructure deployment automation (Layer6 AI)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>MLOps team was manually constructing 500 yaml files to provision infrastructure for machine learning use cases. 90% of information that we provided were duplicate.</li>
      <li>I wanted to automate this manul work.</li>
      <li>I came up with using one configuration file where we supply only 10% information. Then I wrote Python scripts to automatically generate all 500 yaml files based on that 1 configuration file.</li>
      <li>Use case infrastructure provisioning, which used to take 2 weeks were reduced to less than 1 week.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Had to pursuade the team, You led a team or showed leadership, Set goal for others</h3>

    <h5 class="card-title">Inner-sourcing Enterprise DevOps pipeline (Wealth SDDE)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>My team was the user of the pipeline. Because we didn't know the internal mechanics of the pipeline, we had to rely on support whenever we hit any issues. And the supports were very limited due to short staffing in cloud engineering.</li>
      <li>I wanted the team to inner-source to pipeline development.</li>
      <li>I asked the team to select several individuals to inner-source to cloud engineering to work as pipeline developers. This would raise the knowledge of the team and we would be much better enabled to resolve pipeline issues ourselves.</li>
      <li>I was selected as one of the developers to inner-source to the pipeline development. I gained a lot of knowledge working as a developer. The time to resolve pipeline issues went from 3 days on average to less than 1 day because we had much better understanding of how the pipeline worked under the cover.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Had to manage unexpected changes in deadlines</h3>

    <h5 class="card-title">VMC pipeline (Wealth SDDE)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>I was working on long term development of pipeline to provision and configure infrastructure on VMWare cloud. But, I was suddently given 2 weeks deadline. The release date was already communicated to the users in the Enterpise by the leadership without consulting the first line staff in the engineering.</li>
      <li>I wanted to build and release VMC provisioning feature in 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>I gathered all the requirements from the stakeholders. I realized it was impractical to target all of them. I suggested the team to deliver the requirements in phases. First of all, I would finish the infrastructural provisioning for middlewares like jboss, springboot, and nodejs including the core configuration of those infrastructure because those were most critical. Then, I would target allowing users to provide their own custom configuration for the infrastructure in the second phase. Then, the ability to clean up any unused infrastructure would come in third phase.</li>
      <li>The team was able to deliver their initial promise to end users. The end users got what they expected. And the leadership complemented our team's work.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Needed information from someone who was not responsive, Deal with difficult customers/clients?</h3>

    <h5 class="card-title">Azure DataFactory pipeline (Layer6 AI)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>I was deploying Azure DataFactory instance using pipeline but the pipeline lacked functionality to grant permissions to Azure groups. Thus, users could not access the tool that I provisioned.</li>
      <li>I did not have access to make changes in Azure myself.</li>
      <li>I reached out to individuals in Identity and Access Management team in chat and email, but they did not respond. Then, I reached out to their manager, but still no response. After sending out chats several times, I finally got a response from them. And they handed over a document explaining a process for me to go through.</li>
      <li>I was able to grant users access to Azure DataFactory by following their process, which involved raising a Pull Request to their repository and running a build in the pipeline.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Failure / Mistake</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mixing agile and waterfall</li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Biggest weakness</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Timid</li>
      <li>Hard to speak out criticism, fear of speaking up, fear of asking stupid questions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Had to handle criticism, Received really useful feedback</h3>

    <h5 class="card-title">Azure Databricks upgrade (Layer6 AI)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>I was tasked to upgrade machine learing tool called Azure Databricks. The work involved not only myself provisioning the infrastructure but also other engineers redeploying lots of applications to use the new infrastructure.</li>
      <li>I had to come up with a plan so that everyone in the team could work on the same time window to do the upgrade.</li>
      <li>My manager was questioning me when the upgrade could be done because I was having hard time to get everyone agree on a time window. People had different priorities and schedules. The criticism from my manager was that because I was leading this effort, I must come up with a working plan to do this. I started sending out frequent communication over a chat. I invited all engineers into a chat and put the planned actions for the Databricks upgrade activity on a sticky note. And I created a table to show who is assigned to redeploy which application and when they are available to do the work. When a person could not find time to do it, I asked if another person could fill-in. And I promised to provide support when engineers face issues during the deployment.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I was able to complete the Databricks upgrade on time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Past learnings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What stakeholders told me was rarely what they actually wanted. Requirements were never written in a way that delivered context. I realized I needed to interpret the requirements correctly by contiunously asking questions.</li>
      <li>Mixing up agile and waterfall was a mistake because we had fixed deliverables by certain date while allowing new items to come into the sprint. And we end up with infinite amount of work. If some items come in, then some items need to move out.</li>
      <li>Manual testing and deployment hit the limit quickly as the application became more complex. We insisted "due deligence" of human effort but we quickly realized that everyone makes mistakes. Automation is not only recommended, it is necessary.</li>
      <li>When we were estimating the work effort, giving a range of time only made stakeholders assume the shortest. I learned to consider the worst case scenario to always make promise that I can deliver.</li>
