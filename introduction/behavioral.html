    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Past learnings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What business told me was rarely what they actually wanted. Requirements were never written in a way that delivered context. I realized I needed to interpret the requirements correctly by contiunously asking questions.</li>
      <li>Mixing up agile and waterfall was a mistake because we had fixed deliverables by certain date while allowing new items to come into the sprint. And we end up with infinite amount of work. If items come in, then some items need to move out.</li>
      <li>Manual testing and deployment hit the limit quickly as the application became more complex. We insisted "due deligence" of human effort but we quickly realized that everyone makes mistakes. Automation is not only recommended, it is necessary.</li>
      <li>When we were estimating the work effort, giving a range of time only made business assume the shortest. I learned to consider the worst case scenario to always make promise that I can deliver.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">I'd love to hear a bit more about your background and what you're looking for in your next role</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I started out my career as developer because I really liked buidling something.</li>
      <li>I worked as Javascript developer in a startup company and Royal Bank of Canada to build applications.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>I realized development was only a small part of SDLC. And the great challenge almost always came during the release of the application.</li>
      <li>I started working on the field of DevOps when I joined TD Bank.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>In the first team, I took charge of few project and implemented automation wherever applicable.</li>
      <li>Then, there was an organization change, which moved myself into the second team. There I built multibranch pipeline from scratch to provide standarized solution to automate build, test, package, and relase. And this solution was used by all projects within the line of business.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Then, I wanted to take bigger role at bigger scale. So I moved to third team to develop the Enterprise pipeline for the whole bank.</li>
      <li>The pipeline had complex ecosystem and I really enjoyed engineering it.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Throughout the journey, I studied machine learning outside of work because I was really interested in it.</li>
      <li>So, I made it to Layer6 AI, which is machine learning specialized organization within the Bank.</li>
      <li>I am working on designing and implementing machine learning platform.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>I have always looked for opportunities where I could exercise creativity to solve challenging problem.</li>
      <li>I have always looked for team that is passionate for doing what they were doing.</li>
      <li>I have always looked for organization that values engineering mindset and believes in innovation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Achievements</h3>

    <h4 class="card-title">Most challenging experience / Most complex project</h4>

    <h5 class="card-title">Elasticsearch cluster migration (Layer6 AI)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>The team wanted to migrate database solution from major version 6 to 8 in order to leverage the newest functionality.</li>
      <li>I took charge of deploying new database cluster in Kubernetes and migrate data from old database cluster, which was deployed in a set of virtual machines.</li>
      <li>I performed analysis to estimate capacity in terms of compute and storage for the next 5 years. Then, I came up with proper compute and storage requirement for each type of node in the cluster. For example, frequently accessed node would have high compute but lower storage and rarely assessed node would have lower compute but higher stroage. Then, I deployed the new cluster in development environment, then tested it by connecting applications to the new database and running business logcis. The deployment was executed using Helm chart, which included statefulset, services, persistent storage, credentials, certificate, and custom DNS.</li>
      <li>The newly deployed cluster was 10 times faster in write operation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="card-title">ML infrastructure deployment automation (Layer6 AI)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>MLOps team was manually constructing 500 yaml files to provision infrastructure for machine learning use cases. 95% of information we provided were duplicate.</li>
      <li>I wanted to automate this manul work.</li>
      <li>I came up with using one configuration file where we supply only 5 percent information. Then I wrote Python scripts to automatically generate all those yaml files based on that 1 configuration file.</li>
      <li>Use case infrastructure provisioning, which used to take 2 weeks were reduced to less than 1 week.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="card-title">Enterprise DevOps pipeline feature enhancement (Wealth SDDE)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>When users made mistakes in the pipeline configurations, they had to raise new Pull Requests. There was no way update deployment configuration for inflight releases. This caused delays between few days to one week in deployments.</li>
      <li>I wanted to allow users to update pipeline variables without going back to the beginning.</li>
      <li>I could not allow users to update variables in the tool itself because audit claimed that the source of truth must come from GIT. So, I came up with a way to allow users to invoke a separate release which targeted the original release to update its deployment variables. This design passed the audit because that separate release would be triggered based on GIT, which we treat as source of truth.</li>
      <li>User feedback was their deployment time got reduced by twice on average because they didn't have to go back to the beginning each time they realize mistakes in the middle of the releases.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="card-title">EDP local development environment (Wealth SDDE)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>The development team had manually set up the local development environment. It took 3 months on average for a new developer to fully setup the complex pipeline environment in his/her local machine. Also, there were some differences between each developer's local environment, which caused bugs in the code.</li>
      <li>I wanted to overcome this problem.</li>
      <li>I took an initiave to fully automate provisioning and configuration of all pipeline tools. I wrote docker-compose file to deploy containers for tools like BitBucket, Jenkins, XL Release, XL Deploy, and Postgres SQL. I wrote bash scripts to configure all these tools in fully automated way so that everyone in the team would have the exact same local development environment.</li>
      <li>New users started taking only 2 weeks on average to be on-boarded because they did not have to go through configuring all the details of local development environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="card-title">Build something from scratch</h4>

    <h5 class="card-title">Multibranch pipeline (RESL & HOJ)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>We used Jenkins as a tool for continuous integration. Jobs were created manually where scripts were embedded within the jobs. Each job was different, making it very hard to manage the pipeline for each project.</li>
      <li>I wanted systematic approach to setup the pipeline for all projects.</li>
      <li>I wrote multibranch pipeline from scratch using Groovy script so that every project would use the same codebase for continuous integration. And the codebase is stored and updated in one place rather than each job being managed differently.</li>
      <li>Each project in the line of businss reduced time to onboard to continuous integration from 1 week to 1 day on average. Because we established a streamlined way to configure the hooks from code repo to Jenkins and how to configure pipeline for each project in a standardized way.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Made current system better</h3>

    <h5 class="card-title">Enhance Kubernetes cluster (Layer6 AI)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>The Kubernetes clusters we were using for model development and serving were not robust because they lacked monitoring and security.</li>
      <li>I wanted monitoring and security integrated with K8s clusters.</li>
      <li>I used helm charts to deploy datadog, kube-state-metric, and Kubernetes Reboot Daemon for monitoring, collecting metrics, and to automatically reboot nodes after the cloud provider applied patches.</li>
      <li>The time to notice CPU and memory outage was cut by 1 day on average and we were able to solve problems before users could even notice. The time and effort to reboot nodes manually by checking the condition inside the machines have been eliminated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Caculated risk and take</h3>

    <h5 class="card-title">Security Master deployment (Wealth SDDE)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>We were deploying new infrastructure for a project whose load-testing was failing in non-production. We had different infrastructure t-shirt sizes between non-production and production.</li>
      <li>I wanted to complete the production deployment within the given timeline.</li>
      <li>I suggested that we do the production deployment knowing that it is an internal application, user size is limited to the number of IT employees in the bank, which was 8000. Also, the production t-shirt size was twice bigger in CPU and memory.</li>
      <li>The deployment worked. But, I reviewed that we had to increase the t-shrit size in non-production so that it exactly matches the production. So that we could perform accurate testing in non-production environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Disaggreement with team member</h3>

    <h5 class="card-title">Helm chart for API based model (Layer6 AI)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>I updated helm chart for deploying API based model in Kubernetes. My team member claimed that all use cases need to be re-deployed with the updated helm chart immediately.</li>
      <li>I wanted to come up with a conclusion which we could agree on.</li>
      <li>I reasoned that there wouldn't be any difference between updating the chart version now or the next time we do the deployment. My team member still didn't agree. So, I explained the time and effort for doing the deployment, and the benefits of use cases having the lastest updated chart wouldn't exceed the cost of doing it. He agreed at this point and in turned suggested that we updated the code repo with the latest chart version so that the next deployments would be using that version. I agreed and went to updated the code repos.</li>
      <li>We came to an agreement and we ended up saving time for doing that deployment, which would be 1-2 days.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Had to pursuade the team</h3>

    <h5 class="card-title">Inner-sourcing Enterprise DevOps pipeline (Wealth SDDE)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>The whole DevOps team were the users of the pipeline. Because we didn't know the internal mechanics of the pipeline, we had to rely on support whenever we hit any issues. And the supports were very limited due to short staffing in cloud engineering.</li>
      <li>I wanted the team to innersource to pipeline development.</li>
      <li>I asked the team to select several individuals to inner-source to cloud engineering to work as pipeline developers. This would raise the knowledge of the team and we would be much better enabled to resolve pipeline issues ourselves.</li>
      <li>I was selected as one of the developers to inner-source to the pipeline development. I gained a lot of knowledge working as a developer. The time to resolve pipeline issues went from several days to less than one day because we had much better understanding of how the pipeline worked under the cover.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Had to go beyond my responsibility</h3>

    <h5 class="card-title">Supporting Enterprise DevOps pipeline (Wealth SDDE)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>I was inner-sourcing in cloud engineering, working as a developer for the enterprise pipeline. There were individuals hired to support the users of the pipeline. This support was done through an internal forum where users would ask questions and support team would answer questions. Because support engineers were not too knowledgable about the pipeline, users were not happy about the quality of support.</li>
      <li>I wanted to provide much better support for the users.</li>
      <li>I voluntarily started answering the question on the forum whenever I found time after finishing my development work.</li>
      <li>User engamentment on the focum increased about 30% in 3 month after I started volunteering on the forum because users believed that they could get useful help from the forum discussion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Navigate through a difficult situation / Solve a difficult problem</h3>

    <h5 class="card-title">First ML use case onboarding (Layer6 AI)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>In the first week of joining Layer6 AI, I was tasked to on-board infrastructure for a new use case. This was a major task for this team. I was given 2 weeks, which was the same amount of time given to all other experienced members.</li>
      <li>I wanted to provision all necessary infrastrucutre for the new use case.</li>
      <li>I studied the on-boarding document very carefully. Many places in the document did not make sense, so I reached out to team members asking questions and corrected the document. I noted down places for improvement, especially what we could automate. The pipeline to provision the infrastructure was failing in many different places, but I rather than waiting for support engineers to fix it, I investigated the codebase myself to resolve issues.</li>
      <li>It took until the very last day of 2 weeks to finish infrasturcture on-boarding. Team said well down for it was first time for me to do it and they starting showing me trust.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Had to manage unexpected changes in deadlines</h3>

    <h5 class="card-title">VMC pipeline (Wealth SDDE)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>I was working on long term development of pipeline to provision and configure infrastructure on VMWare cloud. But, I was suddently given a very tight deadline, which was 2 weeks. The release date was already communicated to the users in the Enterpise by the leadership without consulting the first line staff in the engineering.</li>
      <li>I wanted to build and release VMC provisioning feature in the pipeline in 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>I gathered all the requirements from the stakeholders. I realized it was impractical to target all of them. I suggested the team to deliver the requirements in phases. First of all, I would finish the infrastructural provisioning for various middlewares (jboss, springboot, nodejs) including the core configuration of those infrastructure because those were most critical. Then, I would target allowing users to provide their own custom configuration for the infrastructure in the second phase. Then, the ability to cleanup any unused infrastructure would come in third phase.</li>
      <li>The team was able to deliver their initial promise to end users. The end users got what they expected. And the leadership complemented our team's work.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Made tradeoffs in your projects / Made short-term sacrifice for long term gain</h3>

    <h5 class="card-title">Log4J (Layer6 AI)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Log4j issue hit Layer6 AI hard affecting most containers running in production in December 2021. The issue came during the weekend, so we had limited responses from the users. If we kept the containers running, we would have serious security risks of RCE (Remote Code Execution). But if we just shutdown the containers, it could impact businesses.</li>
      <li>I wanted to remediate log4j situation as soon as possible.</li>
      <li>I tried to reach out to all users. But seeing people didn't respond, I took an intiative to tell my team that we should shutdown all the containers. It was because I determined the risk of RCE far outweighted the loss of business outputs in the next several days.</li>
      <li>I took 3 days (including the weekend) to patch all the containers and re-stood them up. Although that caused minor business outage where few use cases that ran daily batch inference and ground truth could not run for few days, I still feel it was the right decision to make since Layer6 AI was not exploited by this vulnerability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="card-title">Needed information from someone who was not responsive</h3>

    <h5 class="card-title">Azure DataFactory pipeline (Layer6 AI)</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>I was deploying Azure DataFactory using pipeline but the pipeline lacked functionality to grant permissions to Azure groups. Thus, users could not access the tool that I provisioned.</li>
      <li>I did not have access to make changes in Azure myself. But, I still had to solve this issue.</li>
      <li>I reached out to individuals in Identity and Access Management team in chat and email, but I did not get any responses. Then, I reached out to their manager, but still no response. After sending out chats several times, I finally got a response from them. And they handed over quite complex process to have them do the change I wanted.</li>
      <li>I was able to grant users access to Azure DataFactory by following their process, which involved raising a Pull Request to their repository and running a build in the pipeline.</li>
    </ul>

<!-- If you're actively interviewing (or thinking about interviewing), recruiters and hiring managers are 99% likely to to ask you a variant of this question: "I'd love to hear a bit more about your background and what you're looking for in your next role."

Don't make the mistake that this is small talk. When they ask this, the interview has officially started.

While everyone has their own story + criteria for their next role, there's a general structure for answering this to set the conversation off to a good start. An awesome answer to the question is structured and consists of - unsurprisingly - two key parts: (1) your career story (2) what you're looking for.

For (1) I recommend starting by sitting down and journaling in long-form about your career, starting with your first full time job and ending with the most recent experience. I would split my time between (1a) why you chose each role and (1b) what you did in each role. Write this story down start to finish iteratively under you have the essentials for (1a) and (1b) baked into it.

(1) should be a story that is 2-4 minutes long and genuinely gives the listener a sense for how you've approached career moves in the past and what you've done in each of your roles. This story should be >95% consistent across interviews, with the 5% variation mostly coming from what you choose to highlight based on the role (e.g. when interviewing with a SaaS company you might want to spend more time highlighting SaaS experience in your story).

No lying.

For (2) I recommend a more introspective deep dive into what's genuinely going to be most exciting in a dream role. To make it concrete, I find the most valuable exploration to break down into what needs to be true about (2a) the company (2b) the team and (2c) the role. Each person will have their own process, but defining what *incredible fit* would look like along each of these dimensions will be super helpful in the job search.

Here's why: you're not likely to find 100% fit on every single dimension. So you'll mostly be weighing an option that is somewhere between 10% fit and 90% fit. Without articulating what you're looking for, every opportunity will fall somewhere in the arbitrary grey area b/w TERRIBLE & EXCELLENT. That's too wide.

The final product of (2) should be 1-2 minutes long and give the listener a true sense for what you think will make you happy and energized in your next role. The key difference with (2) vs (1) is that (2) should be 50% tailored to the specific opportunity because this is where you're selling yourself as a great fit.

There's nothing inauthentic about selling yourself just like there's nothing wrong with selling a product you believe in. Don't ever lie about what you're looking for, but if you think you could be equally energized about working in SaaS as in d2c and you're talking to a SaaS company, there's nothing wrong with saying "I'm extremely excited about working in SaaS" and then give the reasons. -->
