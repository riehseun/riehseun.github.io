    <h3 class="card-title">Failure / Mistake</h3>

    <p class="card-text">Mixing agile and waterfall (RBC)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>S</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Was developing a sharepoint application</li>
      </ul>
      <li>P</li>
      <ul>
        <li>New requirements continuously came into the sprint</li>
        <li>Businees were very strict and demainding, so we took those items</li>
        <li>We ended up with totally unmanagable work load</li>
        <li>We had to cut the test to deliever all requirements</li>
        <li>Bugs were released to prodiction, which made business further unhappy</li>
      </ul>
      <li>S</li>
      <ul>
        <li></li>

      <li>I</li>

        <li></li>
      </ul>
      <li>L</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose one of agile and waterfall, and stick to it</li>
        <li>Never mix two of them</li>
      </ul>

    <p class="card-text">Testing application (RBC)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>S</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Was developing a sharepoint application</li>
      </ul>
      <li>P</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The product is vendor tool and we were customizing it with JavaScript</li>
        <li>This vendor tool did not have native support for UI testing</li>
        <li>We relied on manual testing and this hit the limit as the application grew</li>

      <li>L</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Need to communicate to business that we need to have sprints where we don't work on new features but just work on develoepr productivity, which includes automated testing</li>

    <p class="card-text">Work estimate (RBC)</p>

      </ul>
      <li>P</li>
      <ul>
        <li>I gave a range of time based on worst and best scenario</li>
        <li>Businees always assumed the best scenario and exepcted dev team to deliver requirements based on that</li>

      <ul>
        <li>When giving estimates, assume the worst</li>
        <li>It is better to be safe than giving promise that we cannot deliever</li>
