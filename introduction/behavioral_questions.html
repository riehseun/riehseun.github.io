<!-- If you're actively interviewing (or thinking about interviewing), recruiters and hiring managers are 99% likely to to ask you a variant of this question: "I'd love to hear a bit more about your background and what you're looking for in your next role."

Don't make the mistake that this is small talk. When they ask this, the interview has officially started.

While everyone has their own story + criteria for their next role, there's a general structure for answering this to set the conversation off to a good start. An awesome answer to the question is structured and consists of - unsurprisingly - two key parts: (1) your career story (2) what you're looking for.

For (1) I recommend starting by sitting down and journaling in long-form about your career, starting with your first full time job and ending with the most recent experience. I would split my time between (1a) why you chose each role and (1b) what you did in each role. Write this story down start to finish iteratively under you have the essentials for (1a) and (1b) baked into it.

(1) should be a story that is 2-4 minutes long and genuinely gives the listener a sense for how you've approached career moves in the past and what you've done in each of your roles. This story should be >95% consistent across interviews, with the 5% variation mostly coming from what you choose to highlight based on the role (e.g. when interviewing with a SaaS company you might want to spend more time highlighting SaaS experience in your story).

No lying.

For (2) I recommend a more introspective deep dive into what's genuinely going to be most exciting in a dream role. To make it concrete, I find the most valuable exploration to break down into what needs to be true about (2a) the company (2b) the team and (2c) the role. Each person will have their own process, but defining what *incredible fit* would look like along each of these dimensions will be super helpful in the job search.

Here's why: you're not likely to find 100% fit on every single dimension. So you'll mostly be weighing an option that is somewhere between 10% fit and 90% fit. Without articulating what you're looking for, every opportunity will fall somewhere in the arbitrary grey area b/w TERRIBLE & EXCELLENT. That's too wide.

The final product of (2) should be 1-2 minutes long and give the listener a true sense for what you think will make you happy and energized in your next role. The key difference with (2) vs (1) is that (2) should be 50% tailored to the specific opportunity because this is where you're selling yourself as a great fit.

There's nothing inauthentic about selling yourself just like there's nothing wrong with selling a product you believe in. Don't ever lie about what you're looking for, but if you think you could be equally energized about working in SaaS as in d2c and you're talking to a SaaS company, there's nothing wrong with saying "I'm extremely excited about working in SaaS" and then give the reasons. -->
