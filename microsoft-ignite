1. Options for building and running your app in the cloud [Glaucia Lemos]
- selling on Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code (Tons of extension)
- selling on Windows Powershell (they called it new Windows Terminal)
- ARM (Azure Resource Manager) Template : JSON/YAML to describe Azure Resources such as VMs, Services, etc
- Web Apps (PaaS) / Containers (ACI & AKS). Azure Container Instance - quick and short life time. Azure Kubernetes Service - orchestration
- senarios for containers : life-and-shift, microservices, ML, IoT
- VMs : very flexible when deploy in a Scale Set (can define scale conditions/metrics, scale up / out)
- Azure Key Vault : encryption keys, certificates, passwords, SQL connection strings, storage account keys
