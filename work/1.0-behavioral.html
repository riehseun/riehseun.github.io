      <li>S</li>
      <ul>
        <li>All ML use cases were using interactive clusters for computing inference</li>
        <li>Interactive clusters will shut down after 120 minutes of inactivity, during which time the cost will incur</li>
        <li>I wanted to use job clusters because they would terminate immediately after job finishes</li>
      </ul>
      <li>P</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Inference pipeline was executed in Azure DataFactory and the most straight-forward way was to configure job clusters on ADF UI for each use case</li>
        <li>However, TD internal process demanded that any change to ADF must be maded by TD internal pipeline and go through change approval process</li>
        <li>Going through TD process for each use case whenever I needed to make changes to cluster configuration was unrealistic</li>
      </ul>
      <li>S</li>
      <ul>
        <li>I designed a workaround such that instead of configuring job clusters on ADF UI, I store configuration files for each use case in DBFS</li>
        <li>When inference is run on ADF, it would first read corresponding configuration file in DBFS, and create and run jobs based on that configuration</li>
        <li>When I needed to make changes to cluster configurations, instead of deploying ADF changes for all use case, I could just deploy one notebook in ADB which creates the configuration files in DBFS</li>
        <li>The workaround was accepted by the team and team successfully started using job clusters</li>
