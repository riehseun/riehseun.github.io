        <li>I was machine learning engineer at Layer6 AI, AI specialized org within TD Bank</li>
        <li>My team was responsible for ML serving design, MLOps, and ML infrastucture</li>
        <li>My team was using Azure Databricks for computing inference and ground truth</li>
      </ul>
      <li>T</li>
      <ul>
        <li>In Dec 2023, all ML use cases were using Databricks interactive clusters</li>
        <li>Interactive clusters will shut down after certain inactivity, during which time the cost will incur</li>
        <li>I wanted to use job clusters because they would terminate immediately after job finishes</li>
      </ul>
      <li>A</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Because we used Azure Data Factory to trigger Jobs in Databricks, natural solution was to configure Job Clusters on Azure Data Factory UI</li>
        <li>However, TD internal process stated that any change to Data Factory must be made by TD internal pipeline and creating chagne order</li>
        <li>Doing this for each use case would take significant time and effort</li>
        <li>I designed a workaround such that instead of configuring job clusters on Data Factory UI, I store configuration files in DBFS</li>
        <li>When job is run, it would first read onfiguration file in DBFS, and create and run jobs based on that configuration using Databricks API</li>
        <li>Instead of deploying Data Factory changes for all use case, I could just deploy one notebook in ADB which creates the configuration files in DBFS</li>

        <li>I was machine learning engineer at Layer6 AI, AI specialized org within TD Bank</li>
        <li>My team was responsible for ML serving design, MLOps, and ML infrastucture</li>
        <li>In mid 2022, My team used Elasticsearch for storing inference and ground truth data, that is used by our internal application</li>
      </ul>
      <li>T</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The cluster was deployed in 3 virtual machines</li>
        <li>Elasticsearch was outdated at version 6</li>
        <li>It was free version and did not support authentication</li>
        <li>Write was slow, taking more than 3 hours during inference and ground truth</li>
        <li>Disk was nearly full</li>

      <li>A</li>
      <ul>
        <li>In Dec 2022, upgraded Elasticsearch version from 6 to 8</li>
        <li>Capacity estimate for the next 5 years</li>
        <li>Deployed the cluster in kubernetes to leverage auto-scaling and soother integration with inference/gt job also running in Kubernetes</li>
        <li>Higher compute and lower storage to hot nodes and lower compute and higher storage for cold nodes</li>
        <li>Splited each Elasticsearch index into many shards to achieve parallel reads (Each shard did not exceed 600MB)</li>
        <li>Replicated each index into different data nodes to achieve availability</li>
        <li>Took a periodic snapshot of data and store them into storage account to achieve reliability</li>
        <li>Taking snapshot of data from version 6 and restoring it in version 8 word in DEV but not in prod (due to size)</li>
        <li>Thus, I had to do research in the midst of production deployment and leaverage a method called reindexing in Elasticsearch</li>

      <ul>
        <li>No way to update deployment configuration in the middle</li>

      </ul>
      <li>T</li>
      <ul>
        <li>In October 2025, I was tasked to provision self-service data platform</li>
        <li>I had three other members to work with, project manager, front-end developer, and back-end developer</li>
        <li>Platform consisted of internal app rewritten in Reach and Java, and infrasturcture on Databricks and Azure Data Lake Storage</li>
        <li>Initally, I was given until Feburary 2026 deliever it</li>
        <li>However, in the middle of Novemeber, my manager told me that I needed to complete it in two weeks</li>
      </ul>
      <li>A</li>
      <ul>
        <li>I suggested the team to make a number of trade-off to choose speed over tech debt</li>
        <li>We initially designed micro-service API architecture, but I proposed that we go with monolithic to save time</li>
        <li>I suggested the team to skip PR approvals and do direct merge</li>
        <li>I suggested the team to bypass TD internal process of writing change order</li>
        <li>Bypassing PR approval and change order saved two weeks of infra deployment effort, and I provisioned infra in the first week</li>
        <li>Bypassing micro-service API architecture saved months of effort, and the team deployed API in the second week</li>
      </ul>
      <li>R</li>
      <ul>
        <li>We aniticipated about 40 internal users, but in reality about 150 users came to use our platform within the first month</li>

      <ul>
        <li>In December 2021, my manager reached out to me on Saturday</li>
        <li>There was an industry-wide issue where a package that almost every Java application used contained a critical security risk</li>
        <li>That package was called log4j and the risk allowed attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>A</li>
      <ul>
        <li>I suggested the team to immediately shut down all running models in production</li>
        <li>Our models were all batch models, whose inference result can be re-computed at any time</li>
        <li>Impact of shutting down models is not producing inference results for only few days</li>
        <li>I shut down all the containers, patch them with newer version of log4j, and redeployed them by Monday night</li>
      </ul>
      <li>R</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Our models were not exploited by the vulnerability</li>
        <li>If we had API models, I would not have shut down the containers</li>
        <li>Attacker must first compromise firewall to access resources in Vnet in cloud</li>
        <li>Then, they need to break into rules set by network security groups</li>
