      <li>T</li>
      <ul>
        <li>In Dec 2023, all ML use cases were using Databricks interactive clusters</li>
        <li>Interactive clusters will shut down after certain inactivity, during which time the cost will incur</li>
        <li>I wanted to use job clusters because they would terminate immediately after job finishes</li>
      </ul>
      <li>A</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Because we used Azure Data Factory to trigger Jobs in Databricks, natural solution was to configure Job Clusters on Azure Data Factory UI</li>
        <li>However, TD internal process was that any change to Data Factory must be made by TD internal pipeline and chagne order</li>
        <li>Doing this for each use case would take significant time and effort</li>
        <li>I designed a workaround such that instead of configuring job clusters on Data Factory UI, I store configuration files in DBFS</li>
        <li>When job is run, it would first read onfiguration file in DBFS, and create and run jobs based on that configuration</li>
        <li>Instead of deploying Data Factory changes for all use case, I could just deploy one notebook in ADB which creates the configuration files in DBFS</li>
      </ul>
      <li>R</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The workaround was accepted by the team and team successfully started using job clusters</li>

        <li>Impact of shutting down models is not producing inference results for only few days</li>
