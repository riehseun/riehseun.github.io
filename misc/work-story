RBC - Risk Data Agggregation and Risk Reporting

What business told me was rarely what they actually wanted. Requirements were never written in a way that delivered context. I realized I needed interpret the requirements correctly by contiune asking questions.

Mixing up with agile and waterfall was a mistake because we had fixed set of deliverables by certain date while allow new items to come into the sprint. And we end up infinite amount of work. If items come in, then new items need to come out.

Manual testing and deployment hit the limit quickly as the application became more complex. We insisted "due deligence" of human effort but we quickly realized that everyone makes mistakes. Automation is not only recommened, it is necessary.

When we were estimating the work effort, giving a range of time only made business assume the shortest time. I learned to consider the worst case scenario to always make promise that I can deliver, and also apply that principle when doing VSM.


TD - Data Provisioning Pipeline

I have not found interest in what people generally enjoy. We had a team event where most member went out go-karting. What I couldn't understand was that we would drive long time to get there, and drive the kart for several hours, and drive back home. Most team members loved the idea and went there but I didn't. (Partying and grabbing bear in a bar is fun for me but not camping, finishing, or go-karting)
