- Then do company specific questions from Leetcode tagged last 3/6 months and Leetcode Discuss
- Now do Mocks. This is the most neglected part of preparation. These are a must to practice under time control, get feedback, and get the nerves out. These can be free or paid and you get out of it what you put into it.
- Tip: Half your time per question should be in design phase. Have a formulaic approach to each problem. Read the problem, ask questions, create your own new test case(s), note some edge cases, design a brute force solution with it's time/space complexity. Then identify the bottlenecks and propose one or two optimized approaches with time/space complexity. A la Interviewing.io's Interviewing Checklist. Once you know the exact code to write, it only takes 5-10 mins to write it out.

Buy premium (not sponsored) to use their interactive question practice. This is by far the best tool I have seen to allow active learning. You are prompted questions, then need to draw and record your voice explaining it. Then an AI grades you and gives you actually useful feedback. (This is the best tool on the market imo, if you are applying for a 6 figure job, you can afford to spend 50$)
