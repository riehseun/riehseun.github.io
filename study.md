- Then do company specific questions from Leetcode tagged last 3/6 months and Leetcode Discuss
- Now do Mocks. This is the most neglected part of preparation. These are a must to practice under time control, get feedback, and get the nerves out. These can be free or paid and you get out of it what you put into it.
- Tip: Half your time per question should be in design phase. Have a formulaic approach to each problem. Read the problem, ask questions, create your own new test case(s), note some edge cases, design a brute force solution with it's time/space complexity. Then identify the bottlenecks and propose one or two optimized approaches with time/space complexity. A la Interviewing.io's Interviewing Checklist. Once you know the exact code to write, it only takes 5-10 mins to write it out.
