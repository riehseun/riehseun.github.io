"""
Given an array of strings, sort the array in such a way that all anagrams are grouped together.

For example, if the given array input is {"abcd","abc","abce", "acd","abdc"} then output array should be {"abc","abcd","abdc","abce","acd"}.

Note that order among non-anagram strings is not important here.

Instead of returning above array as output, your program could have returned an array having different order of strings
but strings "abcd" and "abdc" must be placed next to each other with no specific ordering requirement among them.

So the output array - {"abdc","abcd","abc","abce","acd"} would also be a correct output.
