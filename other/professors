Hello Professor Lee,

I remember taking your Financial Engineering class back in 2011. After graduating from Engineering Science program, I've started my career as a Software Engineer and currently working as a Lead Engineer (DevOps Lead to be exact, I would love to explain what this is :) if you want to hear about it) in TD Bank. Looking back, I enjoyed the most when I was learning and taking classes back in school and I wanted to do more of that by enrolling in MIE (Masters of Engineering) on part-time basis. Would you be able to tell a little about me like how I had shown interest taking your class and attitude towards academic subjects. I believe I just need to include your email address as a reference during the application process. Please let me know if this is okay :)

Thank you,

Hello Professor Kwon,

I remember taking your Financial Optimization class back in 2012. I also did Capstone project under your supervision (it was 2014!). Looking back now, it was really fun time when I was learning and taking classes. I've been enjoying my carrer in the field of Software Engineering and currently working as a Lead Engineer (DevOps Lead to exact) in TD Bank. But I still have strong eager to learn more and apply more that to my field, that I decied to go for MIE (Masters of Engineering) on part-time basis. Would you be able to tell a little about me on how I showed great interest taking your Financial Optimization class (Although I didn't go to Finance career route, I really loved Applied Mathematicas I learned in the clas) and how I managed to complete Capstone work? (I started in a group of two but ended up a solo project, hope you remember!) I believe I just need to include your email address as a reference during the application process. Please let me know if this is okay :)

Thank you,

Hello Professor Amza,

I remember taking your Distributed Systems class back in 2014. I was studying Financial Engineering back then but started career as a Software Engineer and now work as a DevOps lead in TD Bank (Yes my focus is Automation and Cloud Engineering) Looking back, I feel I enjoyed the most when I was learning Synchronization algorithms, Fault Tolerance, and DB consistencis and I couldn't wait to apply those in real world (a little upset to tell you I am still struggling to establish those) Now that I need to lead the engineering effort for my team and the organization, I feel strong eager to learn more and wanted to do ECE (Masters of Engineering) on part-time basis. Would you be able to tell a little about me on how I showed interest in your class? I believe I just need to include your email address as a reference during the application process. Please let me know if this is okay :)

Thank you,

Hello Professor Engels,

It has seen a couple of years since I've done the Thesis project under your supervision to create a mobile application. Interestingly, I started my carrer as a Software Developer and currently work as a DevOps Lead at TD Bank.
