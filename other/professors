Hello Professor Engels,

I hope you are doing well. I did Thesis project under your supervision back in 2014-2015 to create a mobile app for gamififed employee feedback. Thanks to that experience, I managed to grow up to a Software Engineering Lead at TD Bank. Thinking back, I really appreciate education that I had at University and how it helped shape myself.

I've been thinking about for few years that I want to return to school and start studying again. I researched Masters of Engineering program in ECE on part-time basis where I could further learn to have bigger impact on industry. I wanted to reach out to you asking if you could tell a little bit about me, for example, looking back at Thesis project, were there some passion and postive attitude you could see? (I believe I need to include your email address as a reference during the application process)

Thank you,

Hello Professor Lee,

I hope you are well. I remember taking your Financial Engineering class back in 2011. After graduating from Engineering Science program, I've started my career as a Software Engineer and currently working as a Lead Engineer at TD Bank. Looking back, I enjoyed the most when I was learning and taking classes back in school and I wanted to do more of that by enrolling in Masters of Engineering progeam in ECE on part-time basis. Would you be able to tell a little about me like how I had shown interest taking your class and attitude towards academic subjects. I believe I just need to include your email address as a reference during the application process. Please let me know if this is okay :)

Thank you,
