Hello Professor Lee,

I remember taking your Financial Engineering class back in 2011. After graduating from Engineering Science program, I've started my career as a Software Engineer and currently working as a Lead Engineer (DevOps Lead to be exact, I would love to explain what this is :) if you want to hear about it) in TD Bank. Looking back, I enjoyed the most when I was learning and taking classes back in school and I wanted to do more of that by enrolling in MIE (Masters of Engineering) on part-time basis. Would you be able to tell a little about me like how I had shown interest taking your class and attitude towards academic subjects. I believe I just need to include your email address as a reference during the application process. Please let me know if this is okay :)

Thank you,

Seungmoon Rieh


Hello Professor Kwon,

I remember taking your Financial Optimization class back in 2012. I also did Capstone project under your supervision (it was 2014!). Looking back now, it was really fun time when I was learning and taking classes. I've been enjoying my carrer in the field of Software Engineering and currently working as a Lead Engineer (DevOps Lead to exact) in TD Bank. But I still have strong eager to learn more and apply more that to my field, that I decied to go for ECE (Masters of Engineering) on part-time basis. Would you be able to tell a little about me on how I showed great interest taking your Financial Optimization class (Although I didn't go to Finance career route, I really loved Applied Mathematicas I learned in the clas) and how I managed to complete Capstone work? (I started in a group of two but ended up a solo project, hope you remember!) I believe I just need to include your email address as a reference during the application process. Please let me know if this is okay :)

Thank you,
