Almost 4 years after finishing my undergraduate degree at University of Toronto, I've had privilege to work with a large number of professionals in the field of Software Engineering. It has been very exciting times tackling many real world challenges by learning and applying Software tools and frameworks. However, I observe that there are lots of gaps that have not been addressed by current solutions and we are living with very fragile Software systems. 

One of the central lessons learned from my undergraduate degree was the idea of Parallel Computing and Distributed Systems. However, as opposed to my hope to exercise these lessions to the real world, I found even the most popular and cutting-edge tools in my field still rely on centralized systems and parallelization of executions are not yet in many professionals' minds.

Very important principles of Software Engineering such as isolation and abstraction, which I was hoping to deliver with my educational background, are not treated as high priority but professionals rather focus on delievering business requirements where only short-sighted values can be achieved. I am worried that this makes our Software Systems to degrade as we work.      

There are also wide talks to apply now very popular machine learning technology to build strong and resilent Software systems but it seems there are not many who can really understands how to design and implement such ideas

Therefore, I really want to extend my education to further and deepen my understanding in the field of Software Engineering and Advanced Mathematics. I would thereby play a leadership role in addressing many real world gaps as well as bringing in future technology in my professional field.
