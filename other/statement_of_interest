Over the past 5 years in the Software Engineering industry, I was able to move up from a Junior to a Lead Engineer. There are many Engineering solutions I've designed and implemented yet I feel they have been incomplete at best. More time I spend at work, more I find I need to learn and improve. And without another leap of education, I feel I wouldn't be contributing as much to this fields as I could.

I wanted to pursue Master of Engineering in Computer Engineering to become a really valuable contributor to the solutions that industry needs. Enterprises have been dealing with technical debts due to poorly designed engineering solutions, and I also made many mistakes in the past until I realize this. Cost and inefficiencies are high, thus in order to overcome with, I wanted to be equipped with greater mind that I can achieve from this educational opportunity.
